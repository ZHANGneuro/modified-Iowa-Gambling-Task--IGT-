*. Experimental instruction:

"In this game, your goal is to win as much money as possible. 

For each round, a yellow arrow above one of the four decks of cards above signals that you can make a decision between playing or passing a card from this deck.
You will have <4>s to decide.

If you PLAY, you can win but also lose money (or neither win nor lose money).
If you PASS you neither win nor lose any money.
Some decks will be more profitable than others.

Place your index fingers on the 'a' and 'l' keys on your keyboard.
To PLAY, press the  'a' key. 
To PASS, press the 'l' -key. 
You start with $2000."
